**Ecos y Contrapuntos: A Compendium of Motifs from the Spanish Baroque to Latin American Modernity**

A digital humanities project tracing the evolution and transformation of key literary motifs, exploring how the aesthetic and philosophical concerns of the Baroque are reimagined in modern Latin American works.

## Project Goal

This compendium aims to curate scholarly analyses of literary motifs that bridge the Spanish Baroque period (16th-17th centuries) and 20th-century Latin American literature. Each contribution examines a specific motif's manifestations in canonical and lesser-known texts, highlighting continuities and reconfigurations in language, morality, and artistic excess.

## Structure

- `compendium/motifs/` – Contains individual motif analyses in Markdown format.
- Each motif file follows a standardized structure: Motif, Baroque Manifestation, Modern Reinterpretation, Synthesis.

## How to Contribute

1. Propose a motif via an Issue with the `proposal` label.
2. Create a branch `motif/[motif-name]`.
3. Write analysis in `compendium/motifs/[motif-name].md`.
4. Submit a Pull Request linking to the issue.
